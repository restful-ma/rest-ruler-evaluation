1. Content-Type must be used

A resource that uses `text/plain` even though it clearly has some complex data that needs a representation.

/customers:
    get:
      description: Returns a list of all customers
      summary: Get all customers
      responses:
        200:
          description: Array of customer objects
          content:
            text/plain:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/Customer"


2. CRUD function names should not be used in URIs

DELETE /delete-order/{id}
POST /remove-order/{id}
PUT /update-order/{id}
PUT /edit-order/{id}
POST /change-order/{id}
POST /create-order
POST /new-order
GET /retrieve-order/{id}
GET /get-order/{id}
GET /fetch-orders


3. File extensions should not be included in URIs

GET /customers/{id}/orders.xml
GET /customers/{id}/orders.json
GET /customers/{id}/orders.html
GET /customers/{id}/orders.pdf



4. GET must be used to retrieve a representation of a resource

A common antipattern is using POST for search queries to have more convenient search parameters in the body instead of as (GET) request parameters.

POST /search-publications
{
    "category": "science",
    "publishedAfter": "2020-10-10"
}

POST /events-query
{
    "category": "music",
    "publishedAfter": "2020-10-10"
}

5. Hyphens (-) should be used to improve the readability of URIs

GET /videogames/{id}

GET /weatherstations

DELETE /databaseservers/{id}

6. Lowercase letters should be preferred in URI paths

GET /ToDos/{id}

POST /gameStores/{sid}/videoGames/{gid}

7. A plural noun should be used for collection/store names

POST /customer

DELETE /message/{id}

PUT /article/{id}

8. Forward slash separator (/) must be used to indicate a hierarchical relationship

example for inverted hierarchy (right to left) --> intended purpose is to return all employees from a specific department:
GET /employees/departments/{id}

example with backslashes:
GET /departments\{did}\employees\{eid}


9. A singular noun should be used for document names

GET /departments/human-resources/employees

GET /animals/geese/species


10. A trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs

POST /customers/

GET /orders/


11. GET and POST must not be used to tunnel other request methods

POST /customers/{id}
{
	"method": "update",
	"customerName": "newName"
}

POST /customers/{id}
{
	"operation": "change",
	"customerName": "newName"
}

POST /customers/{id}
{
	"function": "update",
	"customerName": "newName"
}

GET /employees/{id}?method=delete

GET /employees/{id}?operation=remove

GET /employees/{id}?function=delete

12. 401 (Unauthorized) must be used when there is a problem with the client credentials

example where security scheme with basic auth is specified but no 401 response is defined

paths:
  /users:
    get:
      tags:
        - user management
      description: Returns a list of all users
      summary: Get all users
      responses:
        200:
          description: Array of user objects
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: "#/components/schemas/User"
        default:
          description: Unexpected error
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/GenericResponse"
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      description: A user of the system
      type: object
      properties:
        userId:
          type: number
        userName:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
    GenericResponse:
      description: A generic response object with a message attribute
      type: object
      properties:
        message:
          type: string
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
security:
  - BasicAuth: []

13. Underscores (_) should not be used in URIs

GET /concert_tickets

DELETE /archived_orders/{id}

14. A verb or verb phrase should be used for controller names

POST /backups/{id}/restoration

POST /customers/{id}/notification
