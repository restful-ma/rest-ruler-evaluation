Custom violations for new rules:


1. Must use official HTTP status codes: https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#243

- An endpoint that returns "495 SSL Certificate Error" instead of "400 Bad Request" (done by nginx)
- An endpoint that returns "400 Client Error" instead of "400 Bad Request" (or other non-standard variations of the text)
- An endpoint that returns "401 Forbidden" instead of "401 Unauthorized"
- An endpoint that returns "403 Unauthorized" instead of "403 Forbidden"
- An endpoint that returns "200 Success" instead of "200 OK"

2. Must use normalized paths without empty path segments: https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#136

- GET /customers//{customerId}/
- POST /categories/{categoryId}//products
- DELETE /locations//{lid}/employees/{eid}/

3. Must contain API meta information: https://opensource.zalando.com/restful-api-guidelines/#218

- #/info/version as empty
- #/info/version as "no version"
- #/info/description as empty
- #/info/description as "Lorem ipsum"

4. Using camelCase convention in the URIs: The tool currently enforces kebab-case, I added a new option to check for conformance to camelCase, depending on the preference of the tool's user.

- GET /location-managers
- PUT /CloudServices/{id}
- POST /members-of-parliament
- DELETE /shopping_cart/{id}
