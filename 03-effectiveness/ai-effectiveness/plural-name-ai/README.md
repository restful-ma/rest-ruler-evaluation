# RESTRuler: Evaluation of AI integration in the rule "A plural noun should be used for collection or store names"

This directory contains resources that are related to the effectiveness evaluation of the rule "A plural noun should be used for collection or store names"  
This rule was originally implemented using a custom ML model. We then used a ChatGPT integration to evaluate compliance to this rule. To evaluate the rule, we created a build (jar) of the CLI where only this rule is active (the other rules are deactived in this build), so it is easier to test and save the results programmatically. Also, this rule was later improved and it's scope was expanded, so currently, it doesn't only check whether a plural noun is used for collection or store names, but instead it checks whether a given path in the API follows a pattern such as "singular / plural / singular / plural..." or "plural / singular / plural / singular..." etc. It reports no violation if the path correctly alternates between singular and plural nouns.
