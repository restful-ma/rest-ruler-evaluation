# RESTRuler: Evaluation of AI integration in the rule "Description of request should match with the type of the request"

This directory contains resources that are related to the effectiveness evaluation of the rule "Description of request should match with the type of the request" with an AI integration.  
This rule was originally implemented using a custom ML model. We then used a ChatGPT integration to evaluate compliance to this rule. To evaluate the rule, we created a build (jar) of the CLI where only this rule is active (the other rules are deactived in this build), so it is easier to test and save the results programmatically.
